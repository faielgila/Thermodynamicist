# Thermodynamicist
*Thermodynamicist* is a thermodynamics calculator and process simulation program, built to be simple-to-use while also being widely applicable.

Most equations are pulled from Sandler's *Chemical, Biochemical, and Engineering Thermodynamics (5th edition)*, while most of the chemical data comes from *Perry's Chemical Engineering Handbook*. These references are cited in the relevant code which makes use of them.

## History
The spiritual predecessor to this program was written in MATLAB by Professor Ali Mohraz from the University of California, Irvine.
I originally began writing this program in Java (since I know it the best) but was convinced to switch to C# and .NET for better UI and performance.
Construction began around the beginning of May 2022, and has been inching its way from "a small thing I'm working on" to "hey that's kinda cool" ever since.
