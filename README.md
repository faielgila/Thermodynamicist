# Thermodynamicist
Does some thermodynamic calculations for chemical engineering.
Many equations as well as the built-in data tables are pulled from Sandler's *Chemical, Biochemical, and Engineering Thermodynamics (5th edition)*.
Those equations are referenced with comments above the relevant code.

## History
The spiritual predecessor to this program was written in MATLAB by Professor Ali Mohraz from the University of California, Irvine.
I originally began writing this program in Java (since I know it the best) but was convinced to switch to C# and .NET for better UI and performance.
Construction began around the beginning of May 2022, and has been inching its way from "a small thing I'm working on" to "hey that's kinda cool" ever since.
